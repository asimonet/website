Next week I will be at the
[IC2E](http://conferences.computer.org/IC2E/2016/){:target="_blank"}
conference in Berlin and will present an article at the
[Intercloud](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/intercloud2016.html){:target="_blank"}
workshop.

I will be there from Monday 4th to Friday 8th, in case anyone wants to discuss
distributed cloud around a German lager.

The paper discusses the economical viability of distributed IaaS infrastructures
composed of hundreds to thousands of micro/nano data-centers. We identify
possible actors, introduce qualitative metrics to describe the infrastructures
each can produce, and give a cost model. We instantiate the cost model for three
actors and compare the cost of the VM they can prodive with those Amazon does.

This work is part of and funded by the [Discovery
Initiative](http://beyondtheclouds.github.io/){:target="_blank"} that I
encourage you to check
out.
