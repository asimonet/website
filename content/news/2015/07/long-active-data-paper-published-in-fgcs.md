Today I am very excited to announce that a large paper about
[Active Data](http://active-data.gforge.inria.fr){:target="_blank"} has been published in
*[Future Generation Computer Systems](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/future-generation-computer-systems/)*.

This paper, co-authored with [Gilles FEDAK](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~gfedak/){:target="_blank"}
and [Matei RIPEANU](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~matei/){:target="_blank"} from [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"} is meant to be the reference publication about Active Data.<!--more--> It details many
theoritical and technical details about the life cycle meta model, the implementation and the programming model.
Several examples illustrates how the whole system works and can be used as model for adopters waiting for tutorials.

<br />
You can download the complete article [here](/download/FGCS_2015.pdf), and if you
want to learn even more details, I invite you to read my [Ph.D thesis](/download/asimonet_thesis.pdf)
from which several sections of the article are produced. In addition, Chapter&nbsp;3 of my thesis discusses
motivations for many modeling decisions that clarify several aspects of Active Data. Finally, Section&nbsp;3.2 was written
like a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo; to introduce most of the user API.
