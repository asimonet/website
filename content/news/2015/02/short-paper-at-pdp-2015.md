PDP 2015 will take place in Turku, Finland from March 4th to 6th. I will present our short paper entitled
*&ldquo;Using Active Data to Provide Smart Data Surveillance to E-Science Users&rdquo;*, coauthored with
__Ian Foster__
and __Kyle Chard__ from the Computation Institute of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Lab.<!--more-->

The paper presents an approach for implementing a *data surveillance framework* for data-intensive scientific
applications using Active Data. For the sake of the demonstration, the paper describes the implementation of a
surveillance framework for the Advanced Photon Source currently taking place at ANL. The framework keeps track
of experimental data from creation to deletion, offers a high-level view of distributed datasets and allows
end-users to implement smart optimizations and features.

Such features include tweeting to advertise the production of new datasets by the experimental pipeline, detecting
and recovering from failures in a way that was not possible before, and more.<br />

See you in Turku!
