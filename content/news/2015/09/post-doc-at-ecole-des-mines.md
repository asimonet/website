On October 1st, I will make my farewell to the LIP and start a new post-doctoral position at the
[École des Mines de Nantes](http://www.mines-nantes.fr/){:target="_blank"}.<!--more-->

This is a great opportunity as I will be conducting exciting research in the
[Discovery](https://beyondtheclouds.github.io/){:target="_blank"} initiative lead by
[Inria](http://www.inria.fr/){:target="_blank"}! There, I will
be lucky enough to work with [Adrien LEBRE](http://lebre.adrien.free.fr/alebre/){:target="_blank"} and
[Anne-Cécile ORGERIE](http://people.irisa.fr/Anne-Cecile.Orgerie/){:target="_blank"}
<span class="tiny-note">(flattering your future collegues never hurts)</span> on new topics
including Cloud platforms and Energy.

So I just need the time to buy the largest umbrella ever made and I'm there!
