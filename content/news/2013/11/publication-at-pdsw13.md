On Monday November 18th 2013 I will present a paper about Active Data at the [8th Parallel
Data Storage Workshop](http://www.pdsw.org/){:target="_blank"} held in conjunction with the
[SC'13 conference](http://sc13.supercomputing.org/ "Super Computing 2013"){:target="_blank"} in Denver, Colorado.

The paper, entitled *&ldquo;Active Data: A Data-Centric Approach to Data Life-Cycle Management&rdquo;*, describes the benefits
of a data-centric approach to distributed data life cycle management.<!--more--><br />

I will be around SC the whole week in case someone is interested to talk about my work. In case you have interesting
use-cases that you think may (or may not) benefit from the techniques introduced in the talk, do not hesitate and come
talk to me! This is early work and we are always eager for use-cases.

Edit: you can download the paper [here](/download/p39-pdsw13-simonet.pdf) and the
slides [here](/download/PDSW13_slides.pdf).
