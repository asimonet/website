I will give a talk at the University of Chicago Computation Institute on Tuesday November 26th at 12pm.

The talk will be about Active Data: a model and execution system to expose and react to distributed data life cycles. You
can download the slides [here](/download/UCCI_11-26-13.pdf "Slides").

Looking forward to seeing you there!
